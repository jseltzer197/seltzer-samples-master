# Introduction

The eBay Enterprise Commerce Technologies Public APIs are our retail interfaces that are used to access the resources and functionality of the eBay Enterprise Commerce Platform and Integrated Business User Tools.

The Consumer Interaction API provides access to the following resources:

* Categories
* Products
* Promotions
* Carts (Checkout)
* Orders
* Tokens
* Accounts
* Gift Cards

The Consumer Interaction API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure. Access tokens are used for consumer-level authentication and authorization. Request and response payloads are optimized for JSON format.
This document describes the API endpoints and request/response payloads that can be used to integrate external consumer interaction applications with the Commerce Platform.

JSON examples are shown in the dark area to the right.
